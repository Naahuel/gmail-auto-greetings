![Rob Hope's tweet: Gmail Labs idea: When hitting reply on any email, the first line automatically populates: [greeting] [original senders first name] where you can customize greeting in settings. Will be great to prevent typos and difficult names](https://naahuel.github.io/gmail-auto-greetings/rob-hope-tweet.png)
